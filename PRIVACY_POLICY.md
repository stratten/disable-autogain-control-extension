# Privacy Policy for Disable Automatic Gain Control Extension

**Effective Date:** August 2, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 2, 2025

## Overview

The Disable Automatic Gain Control extension ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or access any personal information, including but not limited to:**

- Personal identification information
- Browsing history or website data
- Audio or microphone content
- User preferences or settings
- Analytics or usage statistics
- Device information
- IP addresses or location data
- Cookies or tracking data

## How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely locally on your device and:

1. **Script Injection**: Injects local JavaScript code into web pages to disable automatic gain control when you activate it
2. **Permission Management**: Manages website permissions locally within your browser
3. **Local Storage Only**: Any settings are stored locally in your browser and never transmitted
4. **No External Communication**: Does not communicate with external servers or services

## Permissions Explained

The Extension requests the following permissions for legitimate functionality:

- **activeTab**: Required to inject scripts into the current tab when you click the extension icon
- **contextMenus**: Used to display the "Usage" menu when right-clicking the extension icon
- **scripting**: Necessary to inject the local script that disables automatic gain control
- **optional_host_permissions**: Allows you to grant/revoke access to specific websites on demand

**These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and do not enable data collection.**

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with, communicate with, or share data with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect any data, there is no user data at risk. All Extension operations occur locally within your browser environment.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we collect no personal information from any users, this policy applies to users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update this privacy policy if our practices change. Any updates will be posted in the Extension's repository and the Chrome Web Store listing. Continued use of the Extension after policy changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
