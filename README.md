# [Disable Automatic Gain Control (Chrome Extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-automatic-gain-co/clpapnmmlmecieknddelobgikompchkk)

This chrome extension introduces a toggle that disables the automatic gain
control that web applications like Google Meet enable on your microphone. I
built this extension when I discovered that the gain on my Blue Yeti microphone
was automatically rising when I talked in meetings, and there did not seem to be
any system configuration which prevented this from happening. The enablement of
the extension is controlled on a per-domain basis. For instructions on how to
use the extension, please visit the "Usage" page (click on the Extensions icon
in the Chrome toolbar → find "Disable Automatic Gain Control" → "⋮" More Actions
→ "Usage").
